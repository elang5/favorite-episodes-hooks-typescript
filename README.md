## Description

This is a simple web app using TVMaze's API to serve TV episode data. It is built with TypeScript and React Hooks, and it uses React Suspense for lazy loading. This was an opportunity to simultaneously explore some exciting new React features, as well as increase my TypeScript proficiency. Instead of using Redux, I am using Context API, the useReducer hook and a Redux-like Store to mimic Redux state management architecture. This was a lot of fun to implement and it is a pattern I intend to use in future projects. I also added Material UI to give it some flare and to bolster my knowledge of it.
